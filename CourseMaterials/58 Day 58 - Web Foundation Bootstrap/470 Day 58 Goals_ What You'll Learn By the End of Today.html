It'll allow us to layout and format our websites with ease and cut down on the amount of CSS&nbsp;code we have to write. Although not strictly Python programming, it's essential knowledge for any budding web developer. So I've taken the entire Bootstrap section from my web development course and included it here for you to get a better understanding of this technology. </p><p>If you have already completed my web development course, or if you are already quite familiar with Bootstrap, feel free to watch the videos on double speed or simply just recreate the final project from scratch without watching the videos. After all, repetition is the mother of all skill!</p><p>Your instructor,</p><p>Angela</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
