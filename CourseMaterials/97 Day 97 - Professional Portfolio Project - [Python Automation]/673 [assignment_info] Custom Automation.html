It's your turn to get creative and automate some aspect of your life using what you have learnt. </p><p>This could be an aspect of your job, your schoolwork, your home, your chores. Think about your week and everything that you do on a regular basis, when do you feel like a robot? Which jobs do you find tedious and boring? Can it be automated?</p><p>Here are some stories for inspiration:</p><ul><li><p>Automate an email to your boss to ask for a raise every 3 months. =)</p></li><li><p>Automate your lights so they switch on when your phone is within the radius of your house.</p></li><li><p>Automatically organise the files in your downloads folder based on file type. </p></li><li><p>Automate your gym class bookings.</p></li><li><p>Automate your library book renewals.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/boywle/what_work_activity_have_you_automated/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Automate your job.</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9lp1mn/so_what_have_you_automated_at_home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Automate your home chores.</a></p></li></ul><p>Personally, I had a job in a hospital where I&nbsp;had to arrange all the doctors' shifts in my department (normal day, long day, night shift). It would depend on when they wanted to take annual leave/vacation and the staffing requirements. It started out in an Excel spreadsheet, by the time I was done with it, it was fully automated with Python and doctors were able to view a live version of the rota to see when they can take time off. The code took an evening to write and it saves me 3 hours per week. (More time to watch Netflix and eat ice cream).</p><p>Once you're done with the assignment, let us know what you automated in your life and maybe it will inspire another student!</p></div></div><div class="panel-group" id="accordion"><div class="panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a role="button" class="" data-toggle="collapse" href="#question1">Question 1</a></h4></div><div id="question1" class="panel-collapse collapse in"><div class="panel-body"><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><p>Reflection Time:</p><p>This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project.
