The starting project contains the starting code for the game, we'll walk through the code in the starting project in the next lesson. </p><p>Alternatively, you can create the entire project from scratch by creating a blank project inside PyCharm and create a Turtle screen that is 600px by 600px. You'll also need to turn off tracer(0) and use update() to refresh the screen every 0.1s. If you are confused about this, just use the starting project instead.</p><p>(If you can't use PyCharm, <a href="https://repl.it/@appbrewery/turtle-crossing-start" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here's a Repl.it link</a>)</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
