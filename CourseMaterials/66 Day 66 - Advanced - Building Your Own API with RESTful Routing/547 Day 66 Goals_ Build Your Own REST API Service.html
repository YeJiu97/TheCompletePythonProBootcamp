In a lot of cases, the API allows us to tap into a particular website's data or service. </p><p>Many companies have collected valuable data e.g. Bitcoin prices, Restaurant reviews and provide an API for developers to access this data for a price. Depending on how valuable the data/service is behind the API, these APIs can charge anywhere from $9 to $99 per month for access. Some even charge per API call. </p><p>What if you have access to some information that other people might want to use? E.g. You collected data on all the cafes in a particular city and figured out which ones were suitable for remote-work? Then you could create an API and charge people to access your data. </p><p>But how do you create an API?</p><p>That's what we'll tackle in today's lessons. Building a full REST API from scratch using Flask.</p><p><br></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
