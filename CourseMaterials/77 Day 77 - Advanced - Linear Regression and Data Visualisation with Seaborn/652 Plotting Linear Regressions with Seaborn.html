Well, first off we can spot Cleopatra on the far right. But also, we see that many lower budget films made much more money! The relationship between the production budget and movie revenue is not very strong. Many points on the left are very far away for the line, so the line appears not to capture the relationship between budget and revenue very well at all!</p><p>But does the same hold true for the newer films?</p><h4>Challenge</h4><p>Use Seaborn's <code>.regplot()</code> to show the scatter plot and linear regression line against the <code>new_films</code>.<br><br>Style the chart</p><ul><li><p>Put the chart on a <code>'darkgrid'</code>.</p></li><li><p>Set limits on the axes so that they don't show negative values.</p></li><li><p>Label the axes on the plot "Revenue in $ billions" and "Budget in $ millions".</p></li><li><p>Provide HEX colour codes for the plot and the regression line.

We can see this visually from the fact that our data points line up much better with our regression line (pun intended). Also, the confidence interval is much narrower. We also see that a film with a $150 million budget is predicted to make slightly under $500 million by our regression line. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-16_14-57-10-7c88b2c9af63e82477610c41a9fe6a4d.png"></figure><p>All in all, we can be pretty confident that there does indeed seem to be a relationship between a film's budget and that film's worldwide revenue. </p><p>But how much of the variation in revenue does the budget actually explain?&nbsp;And how much extra revenue can we expect for an additional $1 increase in the budget? To find out, we need to dive into the numbers underlying our regression model.</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
