So that's encouraging. </p><p>But quite a lot of films lose money too. In fact, all the films in the bottom quartile lose money, since the average cost is $5 million and they only bring in $3.8m in worldwide revenue! </p><p>The minimum domestic and worldwide revenue is $0. That makes sense. If a film never gets screened or is cancelled, then this is the number we would expect to see here. </p><p>On the other hand, the highest production budget was $425,000,000 and the highest worldwide revenue was $2,783,918,982. $2.7 Billion revenue!&nbsp;Holy smokes.</p><p> So which film was the lowest budget film in the dataset?</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-14_17-28-28-0e643636fa2dfc616b2624c049e3be3e.png"></figure><p>I've ... never heard of this film.

Why is there a difference?&nbsp;</p><p>The reason some international films were never screened in the United States.&nbsp; In fact, we can see an example of this in our previous screenshot. "Don Gato, el inicio de la pandilla" made about $4.5 million dollars in the box office, but nothing in the United States. Perhaps they should have screened it there too, considering it cost $80 million to make! </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">zero_worldwide = data[data.USD_Worldwide_Gross == 0]<br>print(f'Number of films that grossed $0 worldwide {len(zero_worldwide)}')<br>zero_worldwide.sort_values('USD_Production_Budget', ascending=False)</pre><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-14_17-49-17-c0c42e8a463d6d79a09dadfe670a1b07.png"></figure></p></div></div></div></body></html>
