Are they typing in the wrong password or does their email not exist? It would be a good user experience if, in these situations, we told them what was wrong, instead of just constantly redirecting them back to the login page. </p><p>The easiest way to do this is through Flask Flash messages. They are messages that get sent to the template to be rendered just once. And they disappear when the page is reloaded. </p><p><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/flashing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/flashing/</a></p><p>1. Update the login route so that if the user's email doesn't exist in the database, you send them a Flash message to let them know and redirect them back to the login route. e.g.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-19_10-19-01-9a2006c3c316749ec978a74b6f0b3512.gif"></figure><p>HINT: A &lt;p&gt; tag in the login page will show up as red text. </p><p><br></p><p>2.

Update the <code>/register</code> route so that if the user enters an email that already exists in the database, you should redirect them to the login page and show a flash message to let them know they have already registered. e.g.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-19_10-21-16-3a40073f64c294ef83803763f9143e21.gif"></figure><p><br></p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/b58cf1f98a9460eaf9a9adfd8d8b28e3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SOLUTION</a></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
